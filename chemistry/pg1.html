<h2 class="firsttitle">Understanding Enthalpy Through Energy</h2>

<p class="enthalpyintropara">In order to understand the topic of enthalpy, we first need to understand the basic thermodynamics that underlie almost every chemical reaction. We will start by defining energy, the transfer of energy, the universe, the surroundings, and the concept of systems.</p>

<p class="fir"><strong>Energy</strong> - the ability to do work</p>
<p class="sec"><strong>Energy Transfer</strong> - total energy change of a system </p>
<p class="thi"><strong>System</strong> - a part of the universe that is being studied </p>
<p class="fou"><strong>Universe</strong> - the system plus the surroundings</p>
<p class="fif"><strong>Surroundings</strong> - everything but the system</p>

<p class="enthalpysuppara">Types of energy include <strong>kinetic energy</strong> and <strong>potential energy</strong>. Kinetic energy is energy of motion while potential energy is energy that is stored. For example, the rapidly moving molecules of steam, and a compressed spring, respectively. There are two important things to keep in mind regarding energy. The first is that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. This is the <strong> first law of thermodynamics</strong>. The second is that energy is a <strong>state function</strong>, which means that the change in energy depends only on the current state of the system and not its history or how it arrived there. </p>

<p class="enthsuppo">The transfer of energy can be described by the equation below.</p>

<p class="equationone">ΔE = q + w</p>

<p class="equadesc">(Where <strong>ΔE</strong> is the change in energy, <strong>q</strong> is heat, and <strong>w</strong> is work).</p>
