<h2 class="firsttopictitle">Understanding Enthalpy Through Energy</h2>

<p class="enthalpyintropara">In order to understand the topic of enthalpy, we first need to understand the basic thermodynamics that underlie almost every chemical reaction. We will start by defining energy, the transfer of energy, the universe, the surroundings, and the concept of systems.</p>

<p class="fir"><strong>Energy</strong> - the ability to do work</p>
<p class="sed"><strong>Energy Transfer</strong> - total energy change of a system </p>
<p class="thi"><strong>System</strong> - a part of the universe that is being studied </p>
<p class="fou"><strong>Universe</strong> - the system plus the surroundings</p>
<p class="fif"><strong>Surroundings</strong> - everything but the system</p>
