<h2 class="secondtitle">Understanding Enthalpy</h2>

<p class="secintropara">Now that you know a bit about energy and some of the concepts involved, <strong>enthalpy (H)</strong> can be described simply as heat at constant pressure. Or more accurately, the internal energy of a system plus the product of pressure and volume.</p>

<p class="equationtwo">H = E + PV</p>

<p class="equadesctwo">(Where <strong>H</strong> is enthalpy, <strong>E</strong> is internal energy, <strong>P</strong> is pressure, and <strong>V</strong> is volume).</p>

<p class="equapara">Since internal energy, pressure, and volume are state functions, and all are equal to enthalpy, enthalpy must also be a state function. Remember that for a state function, only the current state of the system matters. In order to determine the current state of a system, intial and final states need to be accounted for. To show change, the Greek symbol delta (Δ) is used.</p>
<p class="equationthree">ΔH = ΔE + PΔV</p>
<p class="equadescthree">Notice <strong>P</strong> does not have a delta symbol. This is to show the fact that <strong>pressure</strong> is held constant.</p>
<p class="equadescthreecont">Knowing that <strong>ΔE</strong> is equal to <strong>q</strong> plus <strong>w</strong>, and if we assume that <strong>w</strong> is equal to -<strong>PΔV</strong>, and therefore, -<strong>w</strong>, substituting them into the equation above we can derive the equaion below.</p>
<p class="equationfour">ΔH = q</p>
<p class="equadescfour">Change in enthalpy is equal to heat (under constant pressure).</p>
